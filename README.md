# MyUbuntuScripts
My time saving Ubuntu related Bash scripts

I use this repository to host a few Bash scripts I run on every fresh installation of Ubuntu. 
Some of the scripts are just time saving collection of day-to-day admin stuff.

# TO DO
I am not a coder at all, so I need help from the community with the following:

* Better NotifyOSD integration: make the notifications show up on time...
* Better documentation.
